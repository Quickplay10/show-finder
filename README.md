# show-finder
During quarantine, many people have spent their extra time watching movies on different streaming services. A common struggle is finding which show to find, as the infinite number of movies can overwhelm. Our app, ShowFinder, defeats this struggle. The user can choose which streaming services they have (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and/or Amazon Prime) and recieve a random show to watch. Ideally this app would work with a database connected to each streaming services' website for a truly random selection. With the constraints, we chose to put in sample values (about 3-5 shows per service) to demonstrate how the app would work if all the shows from each site was included.
